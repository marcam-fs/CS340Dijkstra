# CS340Dijkstra
 Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the least cost path from one node to all other vertices in a graph.
 
 Reproduction:
  - Download 'dijkstra.cpp'
  - Open a terminal and change into the directory the above file was downloaded to: cd directoryName
  - Compile the file: g++ -c dijkstra.cpp
  - Create the object file: g++ dijkstra.o -o output
  - Run the program: ./output
  - When prompted with,
   - "Enter the number of vertices, to a maximum of 100:", enter the number of vertices in your graph (must be <= 100)
   - "Enter the source node, destination node, and weight as positive integers:", enter these values of each edge in your graph (must be positive integers)
   - "Enter the node to find the shortest path from:", enter the source node to be used for Dijkstra's Algorithm

Run:
 - To see a run of this program, please view the 'dijkstra.log' file
